## Ingress stack

### NGINX Ingress Controller

[ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) is an Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. An Ingress resource supports exposing services and configuring TLS termination for each exposed host name.

#### Implementation

By default the **NGINX Ingress Controller** is enabled in *VKPR* installation. An example of configuration :

```yaml
nginx-ingress:
  enabled: true
  controller:
    publishService:
      enabled: true
    autoscaling:
      enabled: true
      minReplicas: 1
      maxReplicas: 3
```

To see more configurations, access the [documentation](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nginx-ingress#configuration). 

### ExternalDNS

[ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is a Kubernetes addon that configures public DNS servers with information about exposed Kubernetes services to make them discoverable.

Inspired by [Kubernetes DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns), Kubernetes' cluster-internal DNS server, ExternalDNS makes Kubernetes resources discoverable via public DNS servers. Like KubeDNS, it retrieves a list of resources (Services, Ingresses, etc.) from the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/) to determine a desired list of DNS records. Unlike KubeDNS, however, it's not a DNS server itself, but merely configures other DNS providers accordinglyâ€”e.g. [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) or [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/).

#### Implementation

By default the **ExternalDNS** is disabled in *VKPR* installation. An example of configuration:

```yaml
external-dns:
  enabled: true
  rbac:
    create: true
  sources:
    - ingress
    - service
  provider: digitalocean
  interval: "1m"
```

To see more configurations, access the [documentation](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/external-dns#parameters). 

## Logging stack

### Loki

[Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate. It does not index logs content, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

#### Implementation

By default the **Loki** is enabled in *VKPR* installation. An example of configuration:

```yaml
loki-stack:
  enabled: true
  serviceScheme: https
```

To see more configurations, access the [documentation](https://github.com/grafana/loki/tree/master/production/helm).

## Monitoring stack

### Prometheus Stack

[Prometheus Stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) a collection of Kubernetes manifests, [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) dashboards, and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) rules combined with documentation and scripts to provide easy to operate end-to-end Kubernetes cluster monitoring with Prometheus using the Prometheus Operator.

#### Implementation

By default the **Prometheus Operator** is enabled in *VKPR* installation. An example of configuration:

```yaml
kube-prometheus-stack:
  enabled: true
  prometheusOperator:
    enabled: true
    createCustomResource: false
    cleanupCustomResource: false
  prometheus:
    enabled: true
  alertmanager:
    enabled: false
  grafana:
    enabled: true
    sidecar:
      datasources:
        enabled: true
    persistence:
      enabled: false
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      hosts:
      - grafana.<DOMAIN>
```

To see more configurations, access the [documentation](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack).

### Jaeger

[Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger) is a distributed tracing system released as open source. It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems.

#### Implementation

By default the **Jaeger** is disabled in *VKPR* installation. An example of configuration:

```yaml
jaeger:
  enabled: true
  cassandra:
    config:
      max_heap_size: 1024M
      heap_new_size: 256M
      cluster_size: 1
    persistence:
      enabled: true
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 2048Mi
        cpu: 0.4
      limits:
        memory: 2048Mi
        cpu: 1.0
  query:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      hosts:
      - jaeger.<DOMAIN>
```

To see more configurations, access the [documentation](https://github.com/jaegertracing/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/jaeger).

## Security stack

### Cert Manager

[cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) is a Kubernetes addon to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates from various issuing sources.

It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date periodically, and attempt to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.

#### Implementation

By default the **cert-manager** is disabled in *VKPR* installation. An example of configuration:

```yaml
cert-manager:
  enabled: true
  ingressShim:
    defaultIssuerName: letsencrypt-production
    defaultIssuerKind: ClusterIssuer
    defaultIssuerGroup: cert-manager.io
```

To see more configurations, access the [documentation](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/master/deploy/charts/cert-manager/README.template.md#configuration).

### Vault

[Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. 

#### Implementation

By default the **Vault** is disabled in *VKPR* installation. An example of configuration:

```yaml
vault:
  enabled: true
  server:
    ha:
      enabled: true
      raft:
        enabled: true
```

To see more configurations, access the [documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm).

### Keycloak

[Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak) is an Open Source Identity and Access Management solution for modern Applications and Services.

#### Implementation

By default the **Keycloak** is disabled in *VKPR* installation. An example of configuration:

```yaml
keycloak:
  enabled: true
  keycloak:
    username: keycloak
    password: admin123
```

To view more configuration, access the [documentation](https://github.com/codecentric/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/keycloak#configuration).

## Backup stack

### Velero

[Velero](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero) gives you tools to back up and restore your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes.

#### Implementation

By default **Velero** is disabled in *VKPR* installation. An example of configuration:

```yaml
velero:
  enabled: true
  initContainers: 
    - name: velero-plugin-for-aws
      image: velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.0.0
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /target
          name: plugins
```
